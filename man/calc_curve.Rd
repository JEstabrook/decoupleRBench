\title{This function takes the elements of the \code{activity} column and calculates
precision-recall and ROC curves (depending on \code{curve}).
The \code{activity} column is populated with the output for each stat method and
results from the \code{run_benchmark()} function. Each of the elements
in \code{activity} are results from runs of the \link{decouple} wrapper.}
\usage{
calc_curve(df, downsampling = FALSE, times = 1000, curve = "ROC", seed = 420)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{run_benchmark roc column provided as input}

\item{downsampling}{logical flag indicating if the number of Negatives
should be downsampled to the number of Positives}

\item{times}{integer showing the number of downsampling}

\item{curve}{whether to return a Precision-Recall Curve ("PR") or ROC ("ROC")}

\item{seed}{An integer to set the RNG state for random number generation. Use
NULL for random number generation.}
}
\value{
tidy data frame with precision, recall, auc, n, cp, cn and coverage
in the case of PR curve; or sensitivity and specificity, auc, n, cp, cn
and coverage in the case of ROC.
